## Sounds cool! What can I do?

There are many ways to contribute to VueTube. You can contribute to the VueTube app or the VueTube Extractor (the
backend for VueTube) â€” or both!

### What can I work on for the VueTube app?

The VueTube app is written in Vue.js and Capacitor. You can contribute to the app by working on the following:

* Contributing UI/UX improvements (e.g. new themes, new layouts, etc.)
* Adding New features (e.g. new video player features, new video player themes, etc.)
* Adding bug fixes and performance improvements

You can get started by referring to the [Contributing to the Main Repository](./contributing/app.md) page. We recommend
first-time contributors to start with this page.

You can find the main repository [here](https://github.com/pixkk/VueTube).

### What can I work on for the VueTube Extractor?

The VueTube Extractor is written in TypeScript. Currently, it is our top priority to get the extractor up and running as
that will allow for further development of the VueTube app. You can contribute to the extractor by referring to the wiki
in the [VueTube Extractor repository](https://github.com/pixkk/VueTube-Extractor/wiki)

Furthermore, a full checklist of features both already implemented and to be implemented can be found in
the [VueTube Extractor issues tab](https://github.com/VueTubeApp/VueTube-Extractor/issues/59).
