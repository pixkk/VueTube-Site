VueTube Extractor contains all backend code for VueTube. It is written in TypeScript, and is compiled to JavaScript as a
NodeJS module. Although the project is still under active development and is not a part of the main VueTube app, upon
completion, the current API wrapper employed by VueTube will be deprecated in favor of VueTube Extractor.

Therefore, if you wish to contribute to VueTube's backend functionalities, you should contribute to VueTube Extractor.
